# CGStudio
The goal of this project is to port the general interface and most features of Magic Set Editor (sourceforge.net/projects/magicseteditor) to python. The base project has not been updated in three years, and has odd quirks in UX. We plan to implement modern UX improvements, and greater platform independence while maintaining the things that made MSE great.
